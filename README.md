Lung Disease Classifier using Deep Learning

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify lung images into two categories: "Affected" and "Normal". It consists of two main scripts: `test.py` and the model training script.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
    ```
    pip install keras opencv-python numpy
    ```

Usage

 1. Model Training
The model is trained using lung images categorized into training and validation sets. Follow these steps to train the model:

- Place your training images in the `data/train` directory and validation images in the `data/val` directory.
- Run the model training script. This script creates and trains the deep learning model, saving the trained model weights and architecture as `model.h5` and `model.json` respectively.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

2. Classification
Once the model is trained, you can use `test.py` to classify lung images. Follow these steps:

- Ensure the trained model files (`model.h5` and `model.json`) are in the same directory as `test.py`.
- Place the images you want to classify in the `data/test` directory.
- Run the `test.py` script. This script loads the trained model and classifies each image in the `data/test` directory, displaying the prediction results.

```bash
python test.py
```

#
Notes
- The model architecture used in this project consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.
- The model is trained using the `ImageDataGenerator` class in Keras, allowing for data augmentation.
- Ensure your image sizes match the input size expected by the model (512x512 pixels in this case).
- The classification results will be displayed on the console along with the predicted class and the corresponding image.
